# Analysis-on-Stroke-Predictors
Python program for analysing a healthcare dataset on strokes


This project analyses the various factors of a health records dataset downloaded from Kaggle.com. Using various data mining techniques, we identify the 
most important factors for detecting a stroke (i.e. age, average glucose level, and hypertension). Furthermore, by comparing different model approaches, 
we conclude that Logistic Regression with Cross Validation and SMOTE, as well as Nearest Neighbours are the two best models for stroke prediction based 
on our research.
